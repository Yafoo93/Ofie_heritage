                <img src="assets/images/banku2.jpg" alt="Banku and Tilapia">
                <p>Banku and Tilapia is a quintessential Ghanaian dish that combines the tangy taste of banku with the smoky, savoury flavour of grilled tilapia.

It’s typically served with tilapia, which is marinated with spices and then grilled to perfection, offering a crispy skin and tender, juicy flesh.
                     The dish is often accompanied by a spicy pepper sauce or shito, a fiery black pepper sauce that adds an extra kick to the meal. The combination of the soft, tangy banku with the rich, smoky tilapia and spicy sauces makes this dish a favourite across Ghana. Eating Banku and Tilapia is traditionally done by hand, with each bite offering a harmonious blend of textures and flavours that reflect the vibrancy of Ghanaian cuisine.
